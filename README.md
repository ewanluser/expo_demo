# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

   ```

2. **Configure EAS**
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build for different platforms**
   ```bash
   # Build for iOS
   eas build --platform ios
   
   # Build for Android
   eas build --platform android
   
   # Build for both platforms
   eas build --platform all
   ```

4. **Submit to App Stores**
   ```bash
   # Submit to App Store
   eas submit --platform ios
   
   # Submit to Google Play Store
   eas submit --platform android
   ```

### üåê Web Deployment

Since this project supports web, you can deploy it as a static website:

1. **Build for web**
   ```bash
   npx expo export --platform web
   ```

2. **Deploy to hosting services**
   
   **Netlify:**
   - Upload the `dist` folder to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Or connect your Git repository for automatic deployments
   
   **Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```
   
   **GitHub Pages:**
   - Push the `dist` folder contents to your `gh-pages` branch
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

### üì± Development/Testing Deployment

For quick testing and sharing with team members:

1. **Expo Go (Development)**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   Then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app

2. **Development Build**
   ```bash
   # Create a development build
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

3. **Preview Build**
   ```bash
   # Create a preview build for testing
   eas build --profile preview --platform all
   ```
